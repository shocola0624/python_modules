# Python Modules for 42

This repository contains my solutions for the 42 Python modules (Module 00 to Module 10), a set of exercises designed to learn Python fundamentals step by step.

## What you’ll learn (high level)
- Python basics: variables, control flow, functions
- Data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- File I/O and error handling
- OOP: classes, inheritance, polymorphism

## Important notes
- These solutions were **edited after submission**.
- The 42 Python modules are sometimes **updated**, so some subjects may differ from the current official version.

## How to run
Most exercises can be run with:

```bash
python3 <file_name>
```
